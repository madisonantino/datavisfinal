        <p>What a difference a game can make.</p>

        <p>The Nick Saban-lead Alabama Crimson Tide had dominated its historic series against SEC rival Tennessee, winning 60% of the games that didn’t end in a tie since they first squared off in 1901. Going into the teams’ Oct. 15, 2022, matchup in Knoxville, the Tide had won every game since 2007.</p>

        <p>But Volunteers turned the tables on that October day, upsetting the third-ranked Alabama team 52-49. The impact reverberated well beyond the football field. , and in the next year the number of total applicants at UT-Knoxville jumped 28%, according to my analysis of data from the universities Common Data Set.</p>

        <p>This phenomenon isn’t new. Dubbed the “Flutie Effect”, it refers to the almost star power that surrounds a Division I university with a successful sports program. The effect was named for Boston College football player Doug Flutie, whose game-winning Hail Mary pass against the University of Miami in 1984 led to a spike in applicants at BC the following fall. </p>

        <p>It doesn’t just apply to big football games either. When Baylor won the NCAA Tournament in 2021, the analysis found that the number of total applicants rose about 8%. Kansas University saw a 5.7% increase in applicants after taking the title in 2022.</p>

        <p>Like the kids getting recruited to play for these universities, incoming students want to win. When you hear that college is supposed to be the best years of your life, you want those years to be supplemented with week after week of athletic success, because honestly that’s where all those tuition dollars are going.</p>

        <p>That’s why schools with more dominant sports programs seem to never have to worry about dips in application numbers. Clemson University and the University of Alabama haven’t seen a significant drop in applicants in the last eight years, even during the pandemic. When you haven’t gone unranked in football since 2007 and a basketball team that just went to the Final Four, you aren’t worrying about not having enough applicants.</p>

        <p>But why has going to college for a decent sports program become such a widespread goal in the minds of American teenagers? Shouldn’t academics be at the top of the list?</p>

        <p>“Obviously academics were a priority when I looked at schools, but I feel like a solid sports program is what adds to the college experience,” says Lola Antino, a high school senior.</p>

        <p>Antino was one of the many high school students that watched that Tennessee-Alabama game in awe of the Rocky Top’s school spirit. She said that UT-Knoxville, although it boasts a slim out-of-state acceptance rate, was her number one choice heading into application season.</p>

        <p>Like a majority of her peers part of the class of 2024, Antino went from Tennessee’s waitlist to a full out rejection, deciding to commit to Indiana University. She said once she actually had to make a decision based on where she got accepted, academic programs became more important, but the experience as a whole is what mattered most.</p>

        <p>“I want to make the most out of the four years I’ll spend in college, and I really wanted to make sure game days were going to be a big part of the experience,” she said.</p>

        <p>She noted that almost all of her friends attending college this upcoming fall had applied to UT-Knoxville, along with Clemson and Alabama. They had similar wants for where to apply - a common denominator being good sports.</p>

        <p>Antino said she didn’t apply to any schools known for a lacking sports program. She almost applied to the University of Delaware, but took the school off the list once she found that their football and basketball teams weren’t in Power 5 conferences.</p>

        <p>“I don’t really want to spend every weekend watching a losing team, plus I really want to rush the field once,” she said.</p>
